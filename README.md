# PearlCheck

This repo contains the code from [*A simple incremental development of a property-based testing tool*](http://jmct.cc/pearlcheck.pdf) 
by Braquehais et al. (Haskell '17), a functional pearl demonstrating how Haskell's 
LeanCheck property-based testing library is implemented.

The code is located in [`src`](src) :
- [`Parts1To4.hs`](src/Parts1To4.hs) : Parts 1 - 4 of the paper
- [`Part5Onwards.hs`](src/Part5Onwards.hs): Parts 5 - 7 of the paper

To compile, run `stack build`. This repo has been tested with GHC 9.2.5. 

(Some function names have been lightly modified to avoid re-defining 
the same function twice.)

##Â A note about generating random functions

To generate & show functions, the code from Koen Claessen's [*Shrinking and Showing Functions*](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2430532.2364516)
functional pearl (Haskell '12) is currently being reproduced in [`PartialFunctions.hs`](src/PartialFunctions.hs). (Work in progress)
